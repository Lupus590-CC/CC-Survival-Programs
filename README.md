Add this to the top of your file to automatically fetch any modules that you are missing when you require them.
Alternativly, put it into its own file and require that file when you would put this code at the top.

This snippet is based on the one from [Metis](https://metis.madefor.cc/), but it's very heavily modified at this point.

Oh, and if the [original file](custom_require_package_loader.lua) has been modified more recently than this readme then use that file, the actions bot is probably about to update this or is broken. 

```lua:custom_require_package_loader.lua
```
